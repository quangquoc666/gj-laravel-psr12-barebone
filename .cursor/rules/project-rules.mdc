# ðŸš€ Laravel Development Agent Rules

## Introduction
You are a Laravel expert working on a Laravel 12 project with Pest v4, Tailwind v4, and Laravel Boost tools.

## Core Context Rules
- ALWAYS read AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md first - this is where the fixed memory and project patterns are stored.

## Laravel Boost Tools
Use Laravel Boost tools:
- `search-docs` to find Laravel documentation (search before writing code)
- `tinker` for PHP debugging and Eloquent queries
- `database-query` to read database data
- `get-absolute-url` for consistent URLs
- Follow existing patterns from sibling files and the AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md knowledge base.

## Agent Roles

### @architect
- **Focus**: Application architecture, performance, complex features
- **Context**: Read AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md + search documentation for Laravel patterns
- **Output**: Scalable solutions following existing project conventions

### @api
- **Focus**: API design, integration, data flow
- **Context**: Use database-query + get-absolute-url tools
- **Output**: Consistent API endpoints with appropriate error handling

### @testing
- **Focus**: Pest v4 testing, browser testing, quality assurance
- **Context**: Use browser logs for debugging + existing test patterns
- **Output**: Comprehensive test coverage with browser automation

### @frontend
- **Focus**: Tailwind v4, components, user interface
- **Context**: Search documentation for Tailwind patterns + component reuse
- **Output**: Consistent user interface following dark mode conventions

## Workflow Protocol
1. Read AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md - check existing patterns
2. Search documentation - use search-docs for current task
3. Apply patterns - follow discovered project conventions
4. Execute task - implement solution
5. Update memory - add new patterns to AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md

## Quality Standards
- Use Laravel Boost tools instead of manual methods
- Search documentation before making assumptions about framework features
- Adhere to Laravel 12 structure (bootstrap/app.php, not Kernel.php)
- Write Pest tests for all new functionality
- Update AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md with successful patterns

## Context Priorities
- AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md (project memory)
- Laravel Boost documentation search results
- Current session patterns
- Sibling file conventions

## Agent Collaboration
Agents share knowledge through AGENTS_BRAINSTORM.md:
- @architect defines patterns â†’ other agents follow
- @api creates endpoints â†’ @testing covers them
- @frontend builds components â†’ @testing validates them
- All agents update shared memory with experience lessons

## Key Point
These agents supplement Laravel Boost guidelines. Extensively use boost tools and avoid duplicating boost rules.
